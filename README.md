# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains (Woolworths and Coles). It is intended only for personal and educational purpose.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.

The data was collected and then aggregated from web scraping, with the number of requests minimised as possible. I do not take any liabilities for any consequences resulting from the use of this project by others, nor am I affiliated with any of these companies.
