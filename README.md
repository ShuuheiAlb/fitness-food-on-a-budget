# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains (Woolworths and Coles). It is intended only for personal and educational purpose, and I do not promote any endorsements about both companies.

The data was collected as aggregate results via web scraping, and I am trying to minimise the number of requests on the scripts.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.
