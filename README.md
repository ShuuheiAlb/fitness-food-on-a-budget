# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains (Woolworths and Coles). It is intended only for personal and educational purpose.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.

The data was collected from web scraping with the number of requests minimised as possible, then their first 10 search results aggregated. I do not take any liabilities for any consequences resulting from the use of this project by others, nor am I affiliated with any of these companies.

## How to use

Run `supa.py` then `supb.py` (still buggy) then `streamlit run main.py`
