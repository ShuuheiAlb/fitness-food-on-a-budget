# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains (Woolworths and Coles). It is intended only for personal and educational purpose.

The data was collected and then aggregated from web scraping, and I am trying to minimise the number of requests on the scripts. I do not take any liabilities for misuse of this project by others, nor promote any endorsements from these companies.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.
