# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains (Woolworths and Coles). Mainly inspired from [Jeremy Ethier's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAmSbK81_MA), this is intended only for personal and educational purpose.

The data was collected and then aggregated from web scraping, and I am trying to minimise the number of requests on the scripts. I do not take any liabilities for any consequences resulting from the use of this project by others, nor am I affiliated with any of these companies.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.
