## Comparing price of food for various macronutrients

This project is being developed to compare the average macronutrients per dollar of various food sold in two largest Australian supermarket chain: Woolsworths and Coles.

The request urls for Coles are dependent on date/version. I plan to extract them by Selenium at the beginning of the scrapping process.

( Initially forked from AshyBoy91's Web Scraping project )
