# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price for selected food sources sold in two largest Australian supermarket chains: Woolsworths and Coles.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.

The Coles' data incorporation is coming up soon.
