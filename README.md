# "Fitness Food on a Budget" Dashboard

This project compares the amount of macronutrients per unit price among selected food sources available in two Australian supermarket chains.

The data was collected as aggregate results via web scraping, and is intended for personal and educational purpose. I am trying to minimise the number of requests on the scripts.

The current visualisation is here: https://shuuheialb-fitness-food-on-a-budget-main-whza79.streamlit.app/.
