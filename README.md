## Comparing price of food for various macronutrients

This project is being developed to compare the average price of food in Australia for various macronutrients from two largest AU supermarket chain: Woolsworths and Coles.

The Woolsworths' requests are dependent on updated cookies. I will try to automate this process later.

The Coles' requests are dependent on the date and versions of the latest data, and thus needs to be regularly maintained. Previous data are planned to be recorded into spreadsheet.
